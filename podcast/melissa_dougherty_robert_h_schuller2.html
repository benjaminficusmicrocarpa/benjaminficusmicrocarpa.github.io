                                Sin is any act or thought that robs myself or another human being of his or her self-esteem... Hell is the loss of pride... Self-esteem is the single greatest need facing the human race today.

                                "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."
                                <div className="scripture-reference">- Proverbs 16:18 (NIV)</div>
                                <p><strong>Exegesis:</strong> This proverb warns against the very thing Schuller promoted as salvation. Biblical wisdom consistently warns that pride leads to spiritual destruction, not spiritual health.</p>

                            <h3>⚠️ How Schuller Redefined Core Christian Doctrines</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>🔄 Sin:</strong> Not rebellion against God, but "low self-esteem" or "lack of trust"</li>
                                <li><strong>🔥 Hell:</strong> "The loss of pride" and "loss of self-esteem"</li>
                                <li><strong>✝️ Salvation:</strong> Not forgiveness from sin, but restoration of self-worth</li>
                                <li><strong>📖 Gospel:</strong> Not Christ's death for sinners, but affirmation of human dignity</li>
                                <li><strong>📜 Scripture Authority:</strong> "Christ is Lord over the scriptures. The scriptures are not lord over Christ."</li>
                            </ul>

                            <div className="scripture-box">
                                "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse!"
                                <div className="scripture-reference">- Galatians 1:8 (NIV)</div>
                                <p><strong>Exegesis:</strong> Paul's strong warning applies directly to Schuller's redefinition of the gospel. Any message that changes the fundamental nature of sin, salvation, and human need contradicts the biblical gospel.</p>

                            <p>Schuller's "Possibility Thinking" was essentially New Thought mind power repackaged with Christian terminology:</p>

                                <li><strong>🤗 Believe in Yourself:</strong> Faith = self-confidence, not trust in Christ</li>
                                <li><strong>🚫 Remove Negative Thinking:</strong> Eliminate thoughts of sin, guilt, failure</li>
                                <li><strong>👁️ Visualize Success:</strong> Mental imaging to "create" reality</li>
                                <li><strong>🎯 God Wants You to Succeed:</strong> Success equals God's blessing</li>
                                <li><strong>💫 Faith is Possibility Thinking:</strong> Refusing to accept any limits</li>
                                <li><strong>💪 Rebrand Christianity:</strong> Remove "negative" doctrines for self-esteem</li>

                                <h3>🏗️ The Allegory of Glass vs. Rock</h3>
                                <p>The Crystal Cathedral wasn't made of crystal or diamond - it was made of <strong>glass</strong>. It looked pretty and attracted people, but it was fragile and shallow.</p>
                                <p>Scripture says Jesus is the <strong>Rock</strong> - the firm foundation of our faith. When you build your faith out of glass, it might look fancy and attract people, but all it takes is one hard truth, one real rock, to shatter the whole thing.</p>
                                <p><strong>Christ is that Rock.</strong> Schuller preferred glass over the Rock.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div className="scripture-box">
                                "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock."
                                <div className="scripture-reference">- Matthew 7:24-25 (NIV)</div>
                                <p><strong>Exegesis:</strong> Jesus emphasizes that hearing AND obeying His words creates an unshakeable foundation. Schuller's approach removed the very words that challenged people, leaving them with an attractive but unstable foundation.</p>

                                When comfortable Christianity replaces conviction, and if persecution or challenges to faith come, it can collapse under pressure. People end up trading the God who saved them for one they made themselves.

                                <p>This study isn't about attacking people or churches, but about education and discernment. When we know better, we do better. May we build on the Rock, not on glass, and may our churches be places where people encounter the true and living God through His Word.</p>
