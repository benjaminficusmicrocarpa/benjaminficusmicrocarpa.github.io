# Backup Obsolete Files

## ⚠️ EMERGENCY FALLBACK FILES

This folder contains obsolete CSS and JavaScript files that have been replaced by the modern Phase 3 architecture.

**These files should NOT be used in normal operation.**

## 🚨 Quick Emergency Fallback

If the modern system fails:

1. **CSS**: Replace modern CSS links with `css/styles.css`
2. **JavaScript**: Replace modern JS scripts with `js/app.js`
3. **HTML**: Remove data attributes and add back onclick handlers

## 📖 Full Documentation

See `OBSOLETE_FILES_DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete fallback procedures and troubleshooting.

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use the modern system** - these files are kept only as emergency backups.
