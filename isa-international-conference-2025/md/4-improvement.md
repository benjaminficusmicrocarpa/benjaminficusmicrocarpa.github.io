Tab Climate-Biodiversity Nexus:

- Delete the bar chart IPCC AR6: Climate Change Impact Confidence Levels do not represent the data well. instead, replace with isa-international-conference-2025/img/ipcc-ar6-impacts-climate-change.webp. Description of image from IPCC report:
> Figure SPM.1: (a) Climate change has already caused widespread impacts and related losses and damages on human systems and altered terrestrial, freshwater and ocean ecosystems worldwide. Physical water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water quality and demand for water. Global mental health and displacement assessments reflect only assessed regions. Confidence levels reflect the assessment of attribution of the observed impact to climate change
Adding source https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_FullVolume.pdf

- WWF Living Planet Report 2024: Quantified Biodiversity Loss: replace the whole section by reading https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_FullVolume.pdf.
No chart is required for this section, just table and other UI/UX that is formated in css to present data. Put emphasis on data more relevant to the topic of forest carbon storage but still give the overarching view of the report. The replaced section shall of equal length than previous section. Also the sub-section 'Primary Drivers of Biodiversity Loss' shall be retained.

Research methodology tab:
- 🔬 Dual-Method Approach section: Please read https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/8/1354#app1-remotesensing-17-01354 and suggest improvement of the sentence. Suppplement not more than 10% of original content.

- 🧮 Biomass Calculation Methodology: Chemical composition of wood: so instead of writing the number out, use two charts to represent the data: one grouped range bar (grouped by softwoods/hardwoods), andother box plot style (grouped by cellulose/hemicellulose/lignin). Add remarks on function of cellulose/hemicellulose/lignin, its relationship to carbon storage and stability.

Key Findings Tab:
- Carbon storage performance by vegetation type: the height of the chart is too large even for MacBook, reduce it.
- Case Study: Hung Lung Hang Reforestation Site (25 Years): delete the chart all together.
- Transcript Analysis (Dr. Hau): Delete the first two quote retaining the bottom two quote, reframing the box as quote from Billy Hau instead of Transcript Analysis
- Carbon storage by Largest 1% of Trees (Plot-Level Analysis): the height of the chart is too large even for MacBook, reduce it.
- Forest Biomass Comparison: Hong Kong vs. Global ForestGEO Sites: the height of the chart is too large even for MacBook, reduce it.

Recommended Species Tab
- Delete the section: Wood density analysis by Botanical Family as the specific numbers not found in the transcript and sup data
- instead, mention the books published in this year 2025 that details all the findings, see the transcript (more detail on the book from https://www.popticket.hk/en/event/cahk-new-book-releases?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExU3hmdnhJaEkyZjc4Q21jNgEeTOBN-ednk7WzRJIrGPrSxtMwhvYVUKIUOAM-ad3FZ35IZuHGds8o-fE4nQ0_aem_7uI_vt0ZW6zOoHwc2smSWg)

>00:26:45 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>We publish this book which is to promote the use of native tree species. We select 100 species, all natives of different sizes, large, medium, small. We include the carbon performance, as you can see from the chemical, the maintenance, the biodiversity value.

>00:27:09 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>And we also indicate what animal species will utilize the resources offered by individual species. They're also beneficial to biodiversity like this one. I think many compound with this tree.

>00:27:35 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>We also have species that are not so good for carbon storage because it's small in size, but they are very good in offering resources to wildlife. And there are other species which are very good in storing carbon, but they are not very good on the other aspects.

>00:27:51 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>So we try to select species with this different characteristics. The whole idea is with this book in China can actually choose the appropriate species in their planting work, whether in urban area or in reforestation. And we also include the wood density data in the book.

>00:28:12 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>So most of these data are not published or they're published in separate papers. So we try to consolidate all the species we have included in the appendix here, which provide one stop sort of.

>00:28:25 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>Preferences that people can use in the.

>00:28:29 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>Similar type of work. And we found that these families have very good wood density. The higher the wood density, the more carbon is stored. And all and other families that have comparatively lower. So this is also a consideration in selecting trees.

>00:28:55 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>Trees with lower density usually have more grit or wood. They're not as effective during typhoon time to stand up against the wind. So this is another aspect that people take into consideration. Okay, so the next thing is they've been talking about the carbon trading market.

>00:29:16 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>And we hope the result from this study will give a total background on people using trees as a way to store carbon and we can quantify it more scientifically for different purposes. So like local market or the central market we're talking about coming through.

>00:29:36 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>There are also voluntary offset programs like this one in Cape versus which I recently heard they have cancelled it because of the difficulties in assuring the unit of carbon gains by this type of investment. And I would suggest planting tree could be an alternative of offsetting carbon emissions.

>00:29:57 Dr Hau Chi Hang Billy
>And also the information provided here would actually allow it to climb back and forth. Trees have all the trees in our design to achieve better results. So with these. Thank you. Thank you.
