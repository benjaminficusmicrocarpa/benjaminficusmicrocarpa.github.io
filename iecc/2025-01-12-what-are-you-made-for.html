                            <p>Pastor Brett begins by asking a fundamental question that every person asks at some point: <em>"What are you made for?"</em> He illustrates this with a personal story about finding a mysterious object in his drawer—a mic stand attachment—and not knowing its purpose. This mirrors how many of us go through life without understanding our unique purpose.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The sermon references <span class="tooltip-trigger" data-tooltip="Japanese concept combining 'iki' (life) and 'gai' (value/worth), representing one's reason for being">ikigai</span>, a Japanese concept of finding your life's purpose at the intersection of what you love, what the world needs, what you can be paid for, and what you're good at. While this framework is helpful, Pastor Brett emphasizes that from a Christian perspective, discovering your purpose goes much deeper.</p>

                            <div class="scripture-quote">
                                "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
                                <span class="scripture-ref">Ephesians 2:8-9 (NIV)</span>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">He stresses that salvation is entirely by grace—not earned through our efforts. When you stand before God and He asks, "Why should I let you into heaven?" your answer is simply: <strong>Jesus</strong>. Nothing you've done, no church attendance, no good deeds—only Jesus is perfect, and we trust in Him, not ourselves.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">However, Pastor Brett points out that the Greek text doesn't stop there. The translators added a period, but Paul continues:</p>
                            
                            <div class="scripture-quote">
                                "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."
                                <span class="scripture-ref">Ephesians 2:10 (NIV)</span>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This verse reveals that while works don't save us, God has prepared specific good works for each believer. You are God's <span class="tooltip-trigger" data-tooltip="Greek word 'poiema' meaning masterpiece, work of art, from which we get 'poem'">poiema</span>—His masterpiece, His work of art. James reinforces this: "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:26). The assumption is that genuine faith naturally produces good works.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Paul strongly emphasizes: <span class="modal-trigger" onclick="openModal('ignorantModal')">"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant."</span> (1 Corinthians 12:1). What a tragedy to be highly educated but ignorant about the greatest gift you'll ever receive!</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Pastor Brett shares that his spiritual gift is teaching. This doesn't mean he's the best teacher in the world, but he likes it, is competent at it, enjoys it, and feels gifted at it. Importantly, recognizing your gift isn't bragging—God gave it to you.</p>
                            
                            <h4 style="color: var(--primary); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">❤️ H - Heart (Passion)</h4>
                            <p>Your heart represents what you care about more than others do. It's a passion or concern that God has placed within you, sometimes for things that aren't explicitly commanded in Scripture.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Pastor Brett uses the Apostle Paul as an example. Paul was so consumed with spreading the gospel that he suggested everyone should remain single like him to avoid distractions! Of course, he quickly retreated, acknowledging that "if you cannot control yourself, then they should marry, for it is better to marry than burn with passion" (1 Corinthians 7:9). But his heart's burning passion was clearly church planting and gospel advancement.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Pastor Brett confesses: "I think everybody should adopt children." With 153 million orphans worldwide, he secretly believes everyone should adopt—even though he knows God hasn't called everyone to this. Similarly, one church member felt passionate about reducing plastic in the ocean and gave him a reusable water bottle. While Pastor Brett cares about environmental issues, it's not his burning passion.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>The key indicator:</strong> You secretly think everyone should care about your passion as much as you do. What issue makes your heart beat faster? Justice? Human trafficking? The elderly? Prison reform? The environment? Children's education? That's a clue to your heart.</p>
                            
                            <h4 style="color: var(--primary); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">💪 A - Aptitude (Talents)</h4>
                            <p>This is simply what you're good at—your natural talents and proficiencies. No false humility here; everyone is good at something.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Pastor Brett shares a powerful story of a man who approached him and said: "Pastor Brett, I'm not good at leading Bible studies or teaching and preaching. But you know what I'm good at? <strong>Making money</strong>." He wasn't bragging; he recognized his unique ability to close deals and envision business opportunities. He asked Pastor Brett to tell him about needs in the church or ministry opportunities where he could help financially.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Later, when Pastor Brett met a young man in mainland China who wanted theological education but couldn't afford it, he connected him with this businessman. The result? This couple funded 100% of a four-year theological degree so this young man could return and serve the church in China more effectively.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The worship team is another example: they're good at music. While you may love music, if you're not good at it, that's not where you should serve. Pastor Brett jokes about begging Byron to let him sing: "It's not gonna happen, right?"</p>
                            
                            <h4 style="color: var(--primary); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">👤 P - Personality</h4>
                            <p>Your unique wiring matters. Understanding your personality helps you serve in roles that fit who God made you to be, not what drains or frustrates you.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Key personality dimensions:</strong></p>
                            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
                                <li><strong>People-oriented vs. Task-oriented:</strong> Neither is better; they're just different</li>
                                <li><strong>Fast-paced vs. Slow-paced:</strong> Pastor Brett's wife makes decisions instantly while he needs data and time to compare options</li>
                                <li><strong>Outgoing vs. Introverted:</strong> Do people energize you or drain you? Do you restore by socializing or by reading alone?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Pastor Brett and his wife are opposites: she's fast-paced, he's slow. In restaurants, she hands back the menu immediately ("I already know what I want"), while he wants to study all the options. She finishes eating while he's still deciding what to order! But together they make "informed and timely decisions"—her speed balanced by his thoroughness.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The church uses personality assessments (Myers-Briggs, DiSC, Enneagram, StrengthsFinder, etc.) for staff to understand who would be good at what tasks, what work environments suit different people, and how to build effective teams. You should know yourself too.</p>
                            
                            <h4 style="color: var(--primary); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">📚 E - Experience</h4>
                            <p>Everything God has allowed in your life—successes, failures, disappointments, heartache, trauma—happened under His sovereign hand. Nothing is wasted in God's economy; He wants to redeem it all for good.</p>
                            
                            <div class="scripture-quote">
                                "The Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God."
                                <span class="scripture-ref">2 Corinthians 1:3-4 (NIV)</span>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Notice "comfort" appears <strong>four times</strong> in this passage. God comforts you so that you can comfort others with the comfort He provides. This is why Island ECC runs a Divorce Care ministry—led by people who have been divorced. How fitting! God uses your experiences for good.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Your experiences make you who you are right now. Perhaps there are others yearning to be seen, to be understood, who just need to know peace—to feel empathy from someone who has been there. Your experiences matter and can bring healing to others.</p>

                        <span>🦉 Three Wisdom Principles for Your Calling</span>
                        <span class="accordion-icon">▼</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">

                            <h4 style="color: var(--primary); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">1️⃣ God's Commands Are Not Optional</h4>
                            <p>There is a general blueprint for all Christians: to become more Christ-like. This means developing compassion, forgiveness, kindness, generosity, and other character qualities. You don't get to say, "I'm not wired to be compassionate." These are God's commands, not suggestions.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This framework isn't meant to help you opt out of certain character qualities God wants to develop in all believers. The SHAPE assessment helps you understand your unique calling, but it doesn't excuse you from Christlikeness.</p>
                            
                            <h4 style="color: var(--primary); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">2️⃣ Manage Your Passion with Wisdom</h4>
                            <p>Just as Pastor Brett needs to realize not everybody needs to adopt children, you must recognize that your passion shouldn't become others' burden. When you're passionate about something, the tendency is to think everyone should be equally passionate.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">You can present your passion, care about it, recruit people for it, and inform others—but don't demand it takes front and center in their lives as well. Respect that God has given different people different hearts and callings.</p>
                            
                            <h4 style="color: var(--primary); font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">3️⃣ Calling Provides Focus and Boundaries</h4>
                            <p>When you know who you are and what you're called to do, it helps you respond appropriately to what you shouldn't do or don't need to do. If you don't love kids, you can cross out children's ministry from your options—the church wants people who love kids serving there.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Knowing yourself is freeing. You're supposed to live within your calling, make decisions based on it, refine it, schedule around it, care about it, and investigate ways to be faithful to what you care about. This clarity prevents burnout and enables joyful, effective service.</p>

                            <p>As Paul wrote to his young disciple Timothy:</p>
                            
                            <div class="scripture-quote">
                                "I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God."
                                <span class="scripture-ref">2 Timothy 1:6 (NIV)</span>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">God has gifted you, but sometimes that gift can die down. You procrastinate, put it off, let good intentions win over good decisions. Paul says: <strong>Fan that flame. Let it grow. Make sure it takes preeminence in your life.</strong></p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">But also fan into flame the gift of God <em>in other people</em>. When you see people operating in their gifts, encourage them! Pastor Brett shares an example of attending a dinner where the hostess had an incredible gift of hospitality—not just setting a beautiful table, but caring about the people at the table, meeting dietary needs, creating conversation by seating the right people together. He told her: "You're really good at hospitality."</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This kind of encouragement helps people see their gifts and do more of what God created them for. Your affirmation might be the catalyst someone needs to step into their calling.</p>

                        This sermon is <strong>NOT</strong> about volunteer recruitment for church programs. It's about something much bigger: discovering your God-given purpose and aligning your entire life—inside and outside the church—with how He made you. Your calling may be to use your gifts in your workplace, neighborhood, or other spheres of influence.

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                            A church member approached Pastor Brett saying: "I'm not good at teaching or leading Bible studies, but I'm good at making money." He asked to be informed about financial needs so he could help. When Pastor Brett later mentioned a young man in China who needed funding for theological education, this businessman and his wife funded 100% of a four-year degree. Result: A minister equipped to serve the church in China more effectively.

                            <strong>Lesson:</strong> Your aptitude (what you're good at) combined with your heart (what you care about) can create kingdom impact in unexpected ways—often outside traditional "church" ministry.

                            Pastor Brett attended a dinner where the hostess demonstrated exceptional hospitality—not through elaborate decorations or expensive food, but by genuinely caring about the people present. She ensured dietary needs were met, facilitated connections between guests, and created an atmosphere where everyone felt valued.

                            A woman gave Pastor Brett a reusable water bottle, passionate about reducing plastic waste in the ocean. While Pastor Brett cares about the environment, it's not his burning passion—but it clearly was hers.

                                Knowledge without action is incomplete. After reflecting on these questions and the sermon content, commit to one specific, measurable action this week. It could be taking the SHAPE assessment, having a conversation, saying "yes" to something aligned with your gifts, or saying "no" to something that isn't.

            <div class="scripture-quote">
                "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant."
                <span class="scripture-ref">1 Corinthians 12:1 (NIV)</span>
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                Paul is addressing the Corinthian church, which was confused about spiritual gifts. He uses the strong word "ignorant" (Greek: <em>agnoeo</em>, meaning "to be without knowledge or understanding") to emphasize how crucial it is for believers to understand this topic.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                The chapter continues to explain that there are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit; different kinds of service, but the same Lord; different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in everyone. Every believer receives a manifestation of the Spirit "for the common good" (v. 7).
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                Pastor Brett's point: What a shame to be highly educated in worldly matters but ignorant about the greatest spiritual gift you'll ever receive—your God-given purpose and calling.
