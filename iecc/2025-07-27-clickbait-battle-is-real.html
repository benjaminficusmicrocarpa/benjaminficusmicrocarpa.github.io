And I did not realize what was happening, as naive as I am, until she got increasingly flirty. And I thought, hmm, hmm. Now, was this approach from a woman of the street, was that from the enemy? Was that spiritual warfare? Was I just at the wrong place at the wrong time? I walked away, by the way. Just feel the need to finish that story."

It is served up for us so that our hearts can get back into a place of understanding who God is. See, the word won't land well on a heart that is hard."

            <div class="scripture-verse">
                Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.
