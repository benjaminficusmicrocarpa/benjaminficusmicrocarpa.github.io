                <p><strong>The Incident:</strong> Young Tim makes a mistake in baseball, gets publicly humiliated by coach, then wrongly blamed for something he didn't do. Coach screams in his face in front of everyone. 😰</p>
                <p><strong>The Resentment:</strong> Tim carries anger for years, celebrates when coach's new team loses. The resentment "lived rent-free" in his head. 🧠💢</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    🎯 Key Moment: Years later at church, Tim sees the coach worshipping, vulnerable and transformed! 🙏✨
                </div>
                <p><strong>The Resolution:</strong> When Tim finally confronts the coach, the coach doesn't even remember the incident! 🤯 The coach admits: "I was a jerk back then, and I've really been working on that." 💪</p>
                <div class="quote-box">
                    I had been holding on to something for so long, and he didn't even remember it. He was free. I was the one tormented by the whole thing. 🔓😔

                            Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. “Your brother has come,” he replied, “and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.”
                            <br>
                            The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, “Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!”
