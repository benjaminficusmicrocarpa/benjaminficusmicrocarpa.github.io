                    <h4>1. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Choose to Rise Above Offense</h4>
                    <p><span class="scripture">Proverbs 19:11<span class="tooltip">A person's wisdom yields patience; it is to one's glory to overlook an offense.</span></span> and <span class="scripture">Proverbs 12:16<span class="tooltip">Fools show their annoyance at once, but the prudent overlook an insult.</span></span> - Develop thick skin but keep a tender heart. Don't let critics live "rent-free" in your head.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <h4>2. üîÑ Don't Stop Forgiving</h4>
                    <p><span class="scripture">Matthew 18:21-22<span class="tooltip">Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?" Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."</span></span> and <span class="scripture">Luke 23:34<span class="tooltip">Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</span></span> - Forgive for your own benefit, not just theirs.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <h4>3. üö´ Refuse to Play Games</h4>
                    <p><span class="scripture">Matthew 27:12-14<span class="tooltip">When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?" But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge‚Äîto the great amazement of the governor.</span></span> - Jesus refused to be baited. <span class="scripture">Proverbs 26:21<span class="tooltip">As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.</span></span> - Don't feed the fire of arguments.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <h4>4. üéØ Remember Boundaries Are For You</h4>
                    <p><span class="scripture">2 Corinthians 11:20<span class="tooltip">In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.</span></span> - Don't let others exploit you. Set boundaries for your own behavior, not to control others.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <h4>5. ‚úã Know When to Have Nothing to Do With Some People</h4>
                    <p><span class="scripture">2 Timothy 3:1-5<span class="tooltip">But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God‚Äîhaving a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.</span></span> and <span class="scripture">Titus 3:10<span class="tooltip">Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them.</span></span> - Sometimes withdrawal is biblical.</p>

                    <h4>üéØ Example 1: "June" - The Critical Emailer</h4>
                    <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A church member who sent critical emails every Monday, always packaged as "suggestions" but consistently negative.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pastor's Initial Response:</strong> Long, detailed, encouraging replies trying to please her.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> It fed the pattern and made him anxious about preaching, always thinking about potential criticism.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Boundary:</strong> Shorter responses, delayed timing, refusing to let her "live rent-free" in his head.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Sometimes you need to change the dynamic to protect your own peace and effectiveness.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>üöá Example 2: The Kennedy Town Lunch Pattern</h4>
                    <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A friendship where the other person always chose restaurants near his office in Kennedy Town, requiring Pastor Brett to travel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pastor's Initial Response:</strong> Went along with it but grew increasingly bitter, creating a false narrative about the friend being selfish.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Boundary:</strong> Simply suggested meeting in Causeway Bay instead of always Kennedy Town.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Surprise:</strong> The friend happily agreed, revealing Pastor Brett's assumptions were wrong.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Sometimes boundaries protect us from our own false narratives and prevent relationship damage.</p>
