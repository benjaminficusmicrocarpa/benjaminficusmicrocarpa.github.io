                We begin a new series focused on the sticky stuff within our relationships. Every relationship will go through difficult times. An unresolved fight. A broken boundary. Growing apart because of busyness. These are some of the circumstances that cause relationships to fall apart, but is there something we can do about it?

                        <p>We live in a world experiencing a global phenomenon of loneliness. Not because of technology alone, but because we don't know how to repair our relationships when things go wrong.</p>

                        <h3 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The Target</h3>
                        <p>At the heart of broken relationships is <span class="tooltip">contempt<span class="tooltip-content"><strong>Contempt:</strong> A toxic mixture of anger and disgust where you no longer see people for who they are, but rather as pathogens to be avoided. It's viewing someone with superiority and judgment.</span></span> - an ugly mixture of superiority, judgment, anger, and disgust that causes us to dehumanize others.</p>

                        <h3 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The Manner</h3>
                        <p>We must pursue repair with <strong>priority</strong> (even before worship) and <strong>urgency</strong> (don't delay). Contempt will exact its full price if left unchecked.</p>

                        <h3 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The Method</h3>
                        <p>Three-step repair: (1) Name it - identify what happened, (2) Take responsibility - own your part and acknowledge their feelings, (3) State your correction - verbalize what you'll do differently.</p>

                        <h3 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The Gospel</h3>
                        <p>The gospel is the greatest equalizer - we're all sinners who've been forgiven at an extravagant cost. This perspective change empowers us to see others as beloved children of God, not pathogens.</p>

                        <h3 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The Call</h3>
                        <p>"As far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18). We're responsible for how we view others and our attempts at repair, not their response.</p>

                                    <p>A husband whose wife was really upset at him. He didn't know why, tried to defend himself, which made her more upset. They started shouting, went to separate rooms, and didn't talk for days. He stayed at work longer to avoid the situation, hoping it would blow over. Later he said, "Now we're okay. We're not fighting anymore." But there was clearly more to work out.</p>

                                    <p>A lady with a strained relationship with her parents. Every visit, the same questions: "You gotten promoted yet? Why aren't you married? Why aren't you dating? You gained weight?" This constant barrage became a source of pain, bitterness, and resentment. Her solution? Move away from Hong Kong to avoid dealing with her parents.</p>

                                <p>These are real stories in our church - real broken relationships that feel stuck because there's no movement towards reconciliation. These relationships that should be sources of joy and connection have instead become sources of pain and regret.</p>

                                <p><strong>Here's the truth:</strong> These difficulties await every single close relationship. We can choose to repair these relationships (which takes a lot of work), or we can let them fall into disrepair. If you're anything like me, you tend to take the path of least resistance - letting relationships fall into disrepair and moving on when they get beyond saving.</p>

                                <p><strong>Context:</strong> Jesus preaches in Galilee about the altar in Jerusalem (100km away, 4-5 days journey). Imagine hiking there with your offering, reaching the temple steps, then remembering you have contempt against someone back home. Jesus expects you to drop everything, return, reconcile, then come back.</p>

                                    🙏 <strong>Priority:</strong> We have to prioritize repair. We must prioritize reconciliation even before worship. You cannot worship God in spirit and truth if you know you have contempt towards someone or have done something bad to someone.

                                <p>Imagine you're guilty of a crime - 100% guilty - and someone's about to take you to court. What might motivate you to not settle before trial?</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Maybe you think if you keep denying, the judge will declare you innocent</li>
                                    <li>Maybe the judge will condemn you for a lesser crime than you actually did</li>
                                    <li>Maybe if you prove deniability for some small part, you can get away with all of it</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>It's human nature</strong> to think there's benefit in delaying our repair - that in delaying things, it'll be better in the long run. Maybe you let things simmer down, or maybe they'll forget about it.</p>

                                <p><strong>But it's not that simple.</strong> The context for our contempt, most of the time, is in relationships you can't just leave:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your parents will always be your parents</li>
                                    <li>Your kids will always be your kids</li>
                                    <li>Your spouse - you made a vow "till death do you part"</li>
                                </ul>

                                <div class="quote-box" style="border-left-color: #DC3545;">
                                    <h5 style="color: #DC3545; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">1. The Deflector</h5>
                                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Sorry I raised my voice at you, BUT I wouldn't have had to if you had gotten ready on time."</p>
                                    <p><strong>What you've done:</strong> Dismissed the other person's feelings, shifted the blame to them or someone else, or minimized the whole situation.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to spot it:</strong> If you use the word "but" - "I'm sorry, BUT it's your fault / his fault / their fault / it's really not that big of a deal."</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="quote-box" style="border-left-color: #FFC107;">
                                    <h5 style="color: #FFC107; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">2. The Generalizer</h5>
                                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I'm sorry if I've upset you in any way."</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why it fails:</strong> You use the generalizer when you don't know what you're sorry for. You just know someone's mad at you and you hate it, so you throw out a catch-all cliché.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Better approach:</strong> Sit down and figure things out through conversation and personal reflection. What is it that you've done? How have you contributed to the rupture of this relationship? Think through those things BEFORE you apologize.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="quote-box" style="border-left-color: #6C757D;">
                                    <h5 style="color: #6C757D; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">3. The Backhander</h5>
                                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I'm sorry I've had this grudge against you, but I've never respected you for the way you work."</p>
                                    <p><strong>What you've done:</strong> Whether intentional or not, you've used the apology as a further way to insult the person. You've used it to prop yourself up and rid yourself of guilt.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why it's devastating:</strong> It breeds further disconnection. The point of apology is to facilitate and foster reconnection, but the backhander just makes you feel better about yourself.</p>

                                    <p>"So I'm sorry. I take full responsibility for that. It wasn't a compassionate thing to do. Instead it was judgmental, condemning. It made you feel like nothing. It was a rude thing to do."</p>

But keep at it. Even if you get the order mixed up, just make sure these three elements are there. You name it. You know what the situation is. You take responsibility for it. Then you state your correction. Do those three things and you will see - again, it won't solve everything, but it will move you in the direction of repair and reconciliation."</p>

To do that, we need to hone in on the target (contempt), attack it with priority and urgency (like plugging a hole in a ship), and use this three-step approach to move toward repair.

                                <div class="quote-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #F5F1E8 0%, #FFF8E7 100%);">
                                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"Our Father, we come before you with a heavy heart. Because as long as we are human, Lord, we have these relationships that are broken. Sometimes it's easy for us to be so focused on what other people have done wrong to us that we don't acknowledge ourselves what we have done and what we have contributed to the brokenness and rupture of some of these relationships.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 1rem;">We pray on this Pentecost Sunday that your Holy Spirit would reveal those things to us, show us the depths of how we have wronged other people, and give us the courage, Lord. Give us the strength. Give us the conviction to actually take responsibility for those things. To take responsibility for how we have seen other people as less than they are. How we have seen other people as not deserving of our time. How we've come at them with judgment in our hearts, contempt in our spirit. God, we lay that before you.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 1rem;">We recognize, Lord, that you did the exact same for us. We spent so much time not wanting to respond to your reconciliation, but you did the hardest thing. You sent your son. You sacrificed your son for us. And still some of us want to run away from you. God, we grieve our posture. We grieve that we did that to you. And so in light of that, Lord, we pray that you would strengthen us to do the work of reconciliation in our relationships. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen."</p>

                            <p>This passage is part of Jesus's famous Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), where he teaches about the true nature of righteousness that goes beyond external actions to the attitudes of the heart. The main theme: God's standard of righteousness is far beyond what we can attain without Jesus Christ.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>"If it is possible"</strong> - Acknowledges that repair doesn't always work; sometimes the other person won't respond</li>
                                <li><strong>"As far as it depends on you"</strong> - We're responsible for our efforts at repair and how we view others, not for their response</li>
                                <li><strong>"Live at peace with everyone"</strong> - The goal is reconciliation and peace in all our relationships</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We are responsible for changing our attitude and attempting repair, even when the outcome is uncertain. We must do what we can to pursue peace as far as it depends on us.</p>

                                <p>John Gottman and his wife Julie Gottman are experts in marriage who have studied marriages for over two decades, even three decades. They're able to discern to 90% accuracy which couples would end their marriage in divorce and which couples will survive.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>The Love Lab Study:</strong> They created this "love lab" where they invited couples to come in and just talk to each other - talk about their day, something good in their relationship, or a point of conflict. They would just observe that discussion, that conversation. They invited couples back five years later and then every subsequent year until the end of the study, which took place over 15 years.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>The Finding:</strong> After 15 years, a quarter of the couples had ended their marriage in divorce. What they noticed in the couples that divorced: they showed small signs, small microaggressions of contempt - rolling your eyes, rolling your head, sarcasm, name-calling. Those were the couples that most often ended their marriage in divorce, at least to a 90% clip.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Sermon Application:</strong> The question for us, whether married or not, is where does that contempt come from? This research demonstrates that contempt isn't just a theological concept - it's a measurable, observable phenomenon that destroys relationships with scientific predictability.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Four Base Negative Emotions:</strong> Every human being has four base negative emotions. When I say negative, I don't mean they are bad emotions - these are emotions activated when your body senses a threat:</p>
                                <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                    <li><strong>Fear and Anger:</strong> Activated when your body senses a situation where you need to fight back or run away</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sadness:</strong> Activated when you experience loss of someone or something significant to you</li>
                                    <li><strong>Disgust:</strong> Activated when your body senses a pathogen that is dangerous to you. That's why you should feel grossed out by it - when you're grossed out, you avoid it. Anytime you're grossed out by something, that's your brain protecting you.</li>

                            <h4 style="color: var(--secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why This Matters</h4>
                            <p>Anger by itself is not bad - it's a hot emotion showing you really care. If you're angry with someone, you care about the relationship and want things to change.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>But disgust is dangerous.</strong> Disgust is to be relegated to pathogens. People are not pathogens. People are not diseases and viruses to be avoided. When we direct disgust toward people, we dehumanize them.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Name it:</strong> Address and name what it is. Make sure both parties are in agreement with what it is that has caused the rupture of the relationship.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Take responsibility for it:</strong> Instead of deflecting or over-generalizing or backhanding, you take responsibility for what you've done and you also acknowledge how the other person feels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>State your correction:</strong> You verbalize it. You say what it is you will do differently. Make it concrete, make it very clear. Most importantly, verbalize it so that both parties are in agreement with what will change in the future.</li>

                                    <li><strong>The sermon said</strong> that only through Christ can we achieve the perspective change needed to overcome contempt. What would it look like for you to rely on Christ's power rather than your own strength in a specific broken relationship?</li>

                                    <li><strong>Can you identify contempt</strong> (that mixture of anger and disgust) in your own heart toward the person who wronged you? How has that contempt affected you?</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>Even if you didn't initiate the wrong,</strong> how have you contributed to the ongoing rupture through your response? Can you take responsibility for that part?</li>

                                    <li><strong>Matthew 5:23-24 says</strong> to leave your gift at the altar and be reconciled before worshiping. Is there anyone you need to reconcile with before you can worship God in spirit and truth? Why is reconciliation a prerequisite for true worship?</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>The sermon described</strong> how contempt progresses from small annoyances to complete relational breakdown (the Sally and Joe example). At what stage is your most difficult relationship? What would urgent intervention look like?</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>Dr. Arthur Brooks said</strong> contempt is anger mixed with disgust. When you're angry with someone, it shows you care. But when disgust enters, you dehumanize them. How can you preserve the caring anger while eliminating the dehumanizing disgust?</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>The Gottmans' research</strong> showed they could predict divorce with 90% accuracy based on contempt. What does this tell you about the urgency of addressing contempt in any close relationship (not just marriage)?</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>Pastor Kevin said</strong> his deepest relationships are those that "get through the sticky stuff." What sticky situation are you currently facing that could become an opportunity for deeper connection if you choose repair over avoidance?</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>"Contempt will exact its full price"</strong> (Matthew 5:26). What is contempt currently costing you? What might it cost you if left unaddressed?</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>How does the truth</strong> that "as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18) both free you and challenge you in your most difficult relationships?</li>
                                </ol>

                <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">
                    <strong>🙏 Prayer Focus:</strong> Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal any contempt in your heart toward specific people. Pray for the courage to name it, take responsibility for your part, and state what you'll do differently. Ask God to help you see others as He sees them - as beloved children worthy of repair, not pathogens to avoid.
