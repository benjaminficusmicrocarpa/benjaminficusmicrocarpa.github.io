                    <p>A big prayer is not big because of what you pray for or how eloquently you pray—it's big because of your heart. The prayer of surrender ("not my will, but yours be done") has the power to transform your entire spiritual life, but only when you truly wrestle with what you desire and live in obedience to God's will.</p>

                            <p><strong>Key Scripture:</strong> Matthew 26:36-39</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane, overcome with sorrow "to the point of death." He prayed all night, pleading with God: "If it is possible, may this cup be taken from me." The "cup" refers to the cup of God's wrath—the full punishment for sin that Jesus would drink on our behalf, leading to separation from the Father.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> Jesus didn't just casually say "not my will." He wrestled with God for hours, fully processing what He desired (to avoid separation from the Father) before surrendering. This makes His prayer powerful—not empty words, but genuine surrender after deep wrestling.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The disciples boldly declared they would die for Jesus, yet they couldn't even stay awake for one hour when He asked them to. Jesus said: "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." This wasn't just about physical exhaustion—it was about the gap between their intentions and their actions.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> Most of the disciples weren't present at Jesus's crucifixion. They said they'd follow Him to death, but they couldn't even carry His cross, die alongside Him, or bury Him. When we can't obey God in small things now, what makes us think we'll obey when times get tough?</p>

                                <li><strong>"Not My Will"</strong> - Truly think about what you desire. Process it. Wrestle with God. Plead and petition. Only then, after genuine wrestling, say "not my will."</li>
                                <li><strong>"Thy Will Be Done"</strong> - Are you already living according to God's will? If you aren't obeying God's small commands now (love your neighbor, steward finances, forgive others), what makes you think you'll obey when the cost is greater?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> This is a dangerous prayer. It may cost you what's most important to you—even your life itself. The disciples eventually gave their lives as martyrs because they learned to truly pray this prayer.</p>

                            <p>Pastor Kevin begins by acknowledging that this Fresh Start series is perfect for both new believers and longtime Christians who may have lost their initial fire. He emphasizes that <strong>when your prayer life stalls or stagnates, the rest of your spiritual life will follow suit</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">He shares his personal struggle: "I have never been someone who prays big elaborate prayers, big bold prayers. When I pray, I'm pretty safe. I pray small prayers." He prays for good health and smart physicians instead of miraculous healing; for jobs and promotions instead of divine provision.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">He then shares the story of Ted in Singapore—a man who ministered to disadvantaged youth. When 50 kids showed up instead of 10 for a Christmas party, Ted prayed boldly, believing God would provide. God impressed on him to go fishing, and he caught bucket after bucket of fish miraculously. Pastor Kevin reflects: "If I were in his shoes, my first instinct is not to pray... For Ted, prayer was his first and only option."</p>

                                <p>"A big prayer is not a big prayer because you're praying for a miracle. And a big prayer is not a big prayer because you stand up and you pray in a very eloquent way. <strong>A big prayer is a big prayer because of your heart.</strong>"</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">That heart is captured in the <span class="tooltip">prayer of surrender<span class="tooltip-content">💡 <strong>Prayer of Surrender:</strong> A prayer where you genuinely wrestle with God about your desires, fully process what you want and why, and then sincerely say "not my will, but yours be done"—while already living in obedience to God's will in your daily life.</span></span>.

                            <p>Pastor Kevin explores what caused Jesus such overwhelming sorrow. He shares a personal analogy: when he and his wife did long distance for 18 months, every taxi ride to the airport brought "a wave of sorrow" because of impending separation. Similarly, Jesus was facing separation—not from the disciples, but from the Father.</p>

                            <p>Pastor Kevin was initially puzzled: "Why is physical exhaustion a temptation? Why are the disciples being reprimanded in this way? And then what is this cryptic line: 'The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak'?"</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">He explains that "flesh" in Scripture refers to <span class="tooltip">the selfish part of us<span class="tooltip-content">💭 <strong>Flesh (Biblical Definition):</strong> Not literal physical flesh, but that selfish part of us bent toward self-glory and self-preservation. When Jesus says "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak," He's pointing out the gap between our good intentions and our actual obedience.</span></span> bent toward self-glory and self-preservation.

And then Jesus gives them a simple and small instruction: 'Stay awake.' And they can't do that. If they can't even stay awake for him, how could they ever stand with him through what he was going to have to go through?"</p>

                                <li>Who carried the cross? A random guy named Simon—not a disciple</li>

                                <li>Who took His body down and buried Him? Joseph of Arimathea—not a disciple</li>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">"There's enough talkers in ministry," Pastor Kevin reflects. The same is true in our prayer lives—there are enough people saying "thy will be done" without actually doing God's will.</p>

                            <p><strong>1. Greater Open-Handedness</strong></p>
                            <p>"Open-handed meaning you're not grasping onto your plans. You're not obsessed with your goals in life. If you realize a plan, you're pleased. That's awesome. If you don't realize it, you're also okay."</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>2. Contentment in All Situations</strong></p>
                            <p>"You begin living life with a level of contentment that Paul talks about in the book of Philippians, to be content in all situations, whether living in plenty or living in want."</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>3. Peace and Margin</strong></p>
                            <p>"Greater peace, less anxiety. Greater margin, less busyness. Greater hope, less despair."</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>4. Outward Focus on God's Mission</strong></p>
                            <p>"It actually helps you not fixate on yourself anymore... it's only until we stop fixating on ourselves that we realize, whoa, there's a whole world out there. There's needs elsewhere. And only until you do that do you really see how God is moving around the world, around you. And only then do you see what he wants you to care about."</p>

                                <h3>🎯 Understanding Your Calling</h3>
                                <p>"My definition of calling is pretty simple: It's responding to a need in the world related to the mission of God."</p>
                                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                                    <li>Moses was called to rescue Israel (God's mission to bless nations through Israel)</li>
                                    <li>Jonah was called to preach to Nineveh (God's mission of compassion to all nations)</li>
                                    <li>Paul was called to the Gentiles (God's mission to save all who call on Jesus)</li>

                                    Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
                                    <br><br>
                                    Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter. "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
                                    <br><br>
                                    He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."

                                    When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.

                                    Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"

                    <p>Set aside extended time this week (30-60 minutes) to wrestle with God in prayer about one major area of your life. Don't rush. Be honest. Process your desires. Then, only after genuine wrestling, pray: "Not my will, but yours be done."</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">And then—this is crucial—<strong>take one concrete action this week to align your life with God's will in an area where you've been disobedient.</strong></p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">Talk is cheap. Let your prayer become action.</p>

            </h2>
            
            <div class="scripture-card">
                <div class="scripture-quote">
                    It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another. In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.
                </div>
                <div class="scripture-ref">— Psalm 75:7-8 (NIV)</div>
            </div>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <strong>What is the "cup of wrath"?</strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                The cup represents the full punishment that is reserved for those who are wicked—for all of humanity who have sinned. It's not just a sip of judgment; it's drinking the entire cup "down to its very dregs."
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <strong>What does "to its very dregs" mean?</strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                When you brew something with mixed spices, there's inevitably residue that settles at the bottom—the worst parts. Drinking something "to its dregs" means consuming the entire cup, including all that bitter, unpleasant sediment. It's drinking every last drop of punishment—experiencing the fullness of what we deserve for our sin.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <strong>Why was Jesus so anguished about this cup?</strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                This cup was reserved for us, but Jesus' mission was to drink it on our behalf. It wasn't just about physical pain or death—it was about being separated from God the Father. God is holy and cannot be around sin. So when Jesus became sin for us, He experienced the most devastating consequence: separation from the Father with whom He'd been intimately connected for all eternity.
            </p>

            <div class="key-point" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                <h3>☕ The Gospel in This Cup</h3>
                <p>Jesus drank the cup of wrath—the full punishment for our sin—down to its very dregs so that we don't have to. He experienced complete separation from God so that we can be reconciled to the Father forever. This is why Jesus prayed so desperately in Gethsemane—He knew exactly what this cup would cost Him.</p>
