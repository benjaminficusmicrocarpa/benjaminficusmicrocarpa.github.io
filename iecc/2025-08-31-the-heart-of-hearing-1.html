                            <p>This doesn't mean being afraid of God, but being in awe of Him. It's living your life understanding who He truly is and who we really are in comparison.</p>

                            <p>This might sound discouraging at first, but it's actually incredibly freeing! Here's why:</p>

                                God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore. Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations. He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five. He spoke about plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also spoke about animals and birds, reptiles and fish. From all nations people came to listen to Solomon's wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.

                                "Solomon is responsible for Proverbs, and as we know, Solomon is known as the wisest one that ever lived. That's a lot of wisdom. We're told that he spoke 3,000 proverbs and his songs numbered 1,005. So he was smart, but he was also wise. And what we have is just a curated selection of that - far less than the 3,000 we're told that he records."

                                <li><strong>Comprehensive Knowledge</strong> - His wisdom wasn't just theoretical but covered practical sciences: botany, zoology, music, and literature</li>

And Christians, non-Christians alike, are likely to know the story of when there was a fight over whose baby it actually was. And Solomon's wisdom said, well, let's cut the baby in half, knowing that the real mother would say, no, no, no, let's not do that. And that would reveal the answer."

                                "So a crushed spirit is this picture of someone who's discouraged, despondent, depressed, downcast, suicidal. There's a range. And this proverb here points to the fact that if your spirit is crushed, you can't go on. You can't go on. You can't endure."

                            <p><strong>The Profound Truth:</strong> This verse reveals a hierarchy of human resilience. Your physical body can endure remarkable hardship when your spirit is strong, but even the best external circumstances cannot sustain you if your inner being is crushed.</p>

                                "So it's complicated, isn't it? Here's the point, though. If you don't have a relationship with God, I don't mean just a check-in, a checkoff, an organic, ongoing, conversational, a relationship with God. If that's not part of your life, then you are utterly alone."
                            </div>

                            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> This verse doesn't leave us in despair but points us toward the One who truly knows us - both our pure intentions and our mixed motives. God's ability to "weigh motives" isn't meant to condemn but to provide the honest evaluation we cannot give ourselves.</p>

                            <p><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Regular, honest prayer and Scripture reading become essential not just for spiritual growth but for basic self-understanding. We need God's perspective to see ourselves clearly.</p>
