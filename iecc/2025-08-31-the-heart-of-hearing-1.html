                        <h3>üß† Wisdom vs Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>Knowledge can make you smart, but wisdom teaches you how to live. It's the difference between having facts and knowing how to apply them to real life decisions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bento-item">
                        <h3>üìä Probabilities, Not Promises</h3>
                        <p>Proverbs speaks of what usually happens, not what always happens. It's about life principles with room for exceptions - like Job and Ecclesiastes remind us.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bento-item">
                        <h3>üíù Inner Life Priority</h3>
                        <p>Your spirit can endure physical sickness, but if your inner being is crushed, it's hard to go on. That's why soul care matters more than circumstances.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bento-item">
                        <h3>üå≥ Tree of Life</h3>
                        <p>From Genesis to Revelation, the tree of life represents God's blessing. Christ's death on a tree restores what was lost, offering us the wisdom relationship we need.</p>

                    <h3>üèõÔ∏è A Church's Honest Beginning</h3>
                    <div class="pastor-quote">
                        "When this church started out some 25 years ago, we did a survey in Causeway Bay. Just asking people on the street, what do you think about church? What do you think about faith? What do you think about Christianity? What are your impressions? And the overriding two things that came back was that the church is boring. And the church is irrelevant."
                    </div>
                    <p>This honest feedback shaped Island ECC's mission: to make faith neither boring nor irrelevant, but engaging and applicable to real life. Pastor Brett shares how a seminary professor once said the greatest sin would be to make God's word boring - because God himself is the fascinating creator of the universe.</p>

                <!-- Understanding Proverbs Genre -->
                <div class="insight-block">
                    <h3>üìö Understanding Proverbs as Wisdom Literature</h3>
                    <p>Proverbs isn't law like the Mosaic commandments, nor is it prophecy about future events. It's <span class="tooltip">wisdom literature<span class="tooltip-content">Biblical books that focus on practical living and life skills</span></span> - practical guidance for navigating life with skill.</p>

                    <div class="pastor-quote">
                        "If there's any word that would be synonymous with the book of Proverbs, it's probably wisdom. Different from knowledge - you can be smart and still be a fool - but wisdom actually instructs us on how to live, on how we take the knowledge that we have and apply it in our life."
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>üìñ Practical Reading Tip:</strong> With 31 chapters, you can read one chapter per day based on the date. "In February, you have to do a couple of extra ones, but it's a great way to have a daily diet of wisdom into your life."</p>

                                <p>Proverbs is about probabilities - what usually happens - not promises that guarantee specific outcomes. You can't just read a proverb, name it, and claim it as God's promised truth.</p>

                            <p>God gave us books that deal with exceptions to Proverbs' general principles:</p>
                            <ul style="margin: 15px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Job:</strong> A godly man who suffered greatly despite his righteousness</li>
                                <li><strong>Ecclesiastes:</strong> Life's apparent meaninglessness and exceptions to expected patterns</li>
                            </ul>

                            <div class="pastor-quote">
                                "Who of us wants a life like Job's? We're told that he was godly, he feared God, he prayed, he was devout, and yet his life was a train wreck because God made this cosmic bet with Satan using Job in this little experiment of sorts."
                            </div>

                            <p>These exception books remind us that God is aware of all the complexities of life - both the patterns and the deviations from those patterns.</p>

If your inner being is bad... it's hard to thrive even if your circumstances are good."

                                God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore. Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite‚Äîwiser than Heman, Kalkol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations. He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five. He spoke about plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also spoke about animals and birds, reptiles and fish. From all nations people came to listen to Solomon's wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
