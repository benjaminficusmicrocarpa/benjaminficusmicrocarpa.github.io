                    <h3>🌟 Key Message</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        In John 10, Jesus continues His discourse from being the door to revealing Himself as the Good Shepherd. Using imagery deeply rooted in Old Testament prophecy and the familiar occupation of shepherding, Jesus declares to the religious leaders that He is the loving Messiah God's people had been waiting for.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        This message comes during the Festival of Dedication (Hanukkah), a time when Israel remembered pushing out bad leadership and reconsecrating the temple. In this context of longing for good leadership both spiritually and politically, Jesus audaciously claims: "I am the good shepherd."

                                Pastor Eric begins by explaining how powerful statements gain their meaning from context. Just like Darth Vader's "I am your father" only has shock value when you know the story leading up to it, Jesus' "I am" statements are rich with meaning when we understand the context.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                This passage in John 10 continues from chapter 9, where Jesus addresses religious leaders who have failed as shepherds of God's people. The setting is winter during the Festival of Dedication (Hanukkah), a time commemorating when the Jewish people overthrew bad leadership 200 years prior and reconsecrated the temple after Antiochus Epiphanes desecrated it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's an air of expectation—remembering past deliverance from bad leadership while currently under Roman rule, and internally experiencing spiritual leaders who aren't serving the people well.

                                When Jesus says "I am the good shepherd," He's implicitly saying the current leaders are not. He compares them to hired hands who don't truly care for the sheep—they're in it for personal benefit and flee when danger comes.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                Jesus references Ezekiel 34, where God condemns Israel's shepherds: "You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep. The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought."
                            </p>
                            <div class="quote-box key-quote">
                                <p class="quote-text">
                                    This is a little bit of an awkward moment. Jesus walks in and says, "I am the good pastor." It's offensive, right? It's a lot offensive. But this is Jesus in love confronting the leaders who weren't doing what they should be doing.
                                </p>

                                This is a call to anyone entrusted with "sheep"—whether a team at work, children, a care group, or aging parents. Good leadership means laying down your life, caring for those who go astray, healing the hurt, and nourishing others, sometimes giving of yourself so they can live.

                                Being called sheep is offensive at first, but then humbling. Drawing from shepherds-turned-pastors Phillip Keller and W. Phillip Keller, Pastor Eric describes sheep as:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Easily lost:</strong> No sense of direction, can't find their way even when the fold is in sight</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Distracted:</strong> See luscious grass and wander off the path without meaning to</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Panicky:</strong> When they realize they're lost, every sound becomes threatening, every shadow looks like the enemy</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Defenseless:</strong> Can't run well, have no defensive weapons like horns or fangs</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Helpless:</strong> Can't even get up when on their backs; will die without intervention</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                We can replace these descriptions with ourselves: "I get easily lost and lose my sense of direction in life. I see something shiny, something new, something exciting, and soon I'm off the path. When I panic, everything becomes a threat. I feel defenseless, powerless to affect change in a world I cannot control."
                            </p>
                            <div class="quote-box key-quote">
                                <p class="quote-text">

                                The imagery of the Good Shepherd finding His lost sheep is beautiful—the shepherd joyfully carries the lamb on his shoulders back home. But what the image doesn't show is what happened minutes before: the sheep running away, panicking, not recognizing that the shepherd is the best thing for it.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                Sometimes shepherds have to tackle sheep and bind their legs to rescue them. Even when a good God comes after us, we panic, fearing we might lose what we're chasing, not knowing enough to recognize the shepherd's swift movements are intended for our good.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                We can listen to a million different voices: accomplishment, achievement, production, mattering, security, being right. But Jesus calls us by name—and when He does, everything changes:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Saul, Saul</strong> — why are you persecuting me?</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Martha, Martha</strong> — there's one thing that matters</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Mary</strong> — at the empty tomb, one word and she sees Him</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Lazarus</strong> — called out of death itself</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The Good Shepherd calls His sheep by name because He knows them, loves them, and is trying to rescue them. When we listen to His voice above all others, it changes everything.

                                Jesus warned of "wolves in sheep's clothing"—people who look like they're among you but whose intention is evil. But Jesus Himself is the opposite: <strong>the Shepherd in sheep's clothing</strong>.
                            </p>

                                He is the Good Shepherd who laid down His life, who when the wolves came after the sheep, took the attack on Himself. He died in place of the other sheep. In His three decades of life, He was always the sheep who listened to the Good Shepherd (the Father), showing us what obedience, faithfulness, trust, and faith look like.

                                    He is the shepherd in sheep's clothing. He was the sheep who died in our place, and He was the sheep who showed us what obedience and faithfulness and trust and faith looked like by listening to His Father.

                                Revelation beautifully captures this dual nature: "There is a lamb in the midst of the throne, He will be their shepherd, and He will guide them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's freeing to admit we don't have it all together, that we can't control everything, that we make decisions out of fear. We're not made to be in control. There is One who is, who loves us, who died for us—and that's the Good Shepherd.

So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.<br><br>
                        I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."

You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals. My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them."

                        <p>I'm in the care of someone else. I'm not the one in charge. I've taken my kingdom and surrendered it to the kingdom of God. I am living the with-God life.</p>

                        <p>That's the natural result. I shall not lack anything. That's what Jesus teaches: "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and everything else will be added."</p>

                        <p>What kind of sheep lies down in a green pasture? A sheep that has eaten its fill. If a sheep is in a green pasture and she's not full, she'll be eating, not lying down.</p>

                        <p>A life without lack is one that carries no fear of evil. Our confidence in God soars far above wants and fears. Imagine what that would be like: no fear of life, aging or death, disease or hunger, no fear of any person or creature, not even the loss of all your possessions.</p>

                        God calls us to lead like the Good Shepherd, not like the bad shepherds condemned in Ezekiel 34. Whether you lead a team at work, parent children, guide a care group, or care for aging parents, you are entrusted with "sheep."

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I make decisions out of fear and respond out of panic</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        But here's the good news: <strong>we're not made to be in control</strong>. There is One who is—who loves us, who died for us, who knows us by name, and who will never abandon us.

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">
                        The lot of any sheep depends on the type of shepherd who owns it. The quality of your life depends on whose voice you're listening to. Will you listen to the Good Shepherd?

                    <h3>✝️ Remember the Shepherd in Sheep's Clothing</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        Jesus is not a wolf in sheep's clothing. He is <strong>the Shepherd in sheep's clothing</strong>—the one who:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Laid down His life when wolves came after the sheep</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Took the attack on Himself</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Died in our place</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Showed us what perfect obedience to the Father looks like</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Rose again with authority over death</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                        As we approach Easter, remember that this Good Shepherd didn't just talk about laying down His life—He actually did it. And He had the authority to take it up again.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: 600;">
                        This is the Shepherd we follow. This is the voice we listen to. This is the One who knows you by name and will never let you go.

                        God, you are our great shepherd. It's incredible to read this psalm from a king in the highest position who rightfully humbles himself and says, "I am but a sheep under the great shepherd."
