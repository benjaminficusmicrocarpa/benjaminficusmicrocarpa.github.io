                    Jesus declared, <span class="emphasis">"I am the door."</span> This powerful metaphor reveals that Jesus is the exclusive gateway to God and to a life of true meaning and abundance. Through the story of a man born blind and Jesus' confrontation with the Pharisees, we discover what it means to enter through the door that is Christ.

                            <p>Pastor Albert begins by sharing his love for Scotland and the excitement of entering old church doors and castle doors—never knowing what lies beyond. Sometimes a door leads to ruins, sometimes to magnificent mosaics or historic tombs. A door in China led to what he thought was a tea house but turned out to be someone's home!</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Doors are fascinating because they lead us somewhere—and Jesus uses this everyday image to teach us something profound about himself: <span class="emphasis">"I am the door."</span></p>

                            <p>In John 9, Jesus encounters a man born blind. The disciples ask a shocking question: "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</p>
                            
                            <div class="quote-box">
                                "In Jesus' day, there was a belief that if something bad happened to you or your family, it must be a consequence of somebody's sin—either your own or your parents'."
                            </div>

                            <p>This meant the man lived under <span class="emphasis">two layers of suffering</span>:</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">But Jesus breaks this chain of condemnation with powerful words:</p>

                            <p>Jesus then tells a parable about sheep, shepherds, and gates. In ancient times, there were two types of sheep pens:</p>

                            <h4 style="font-weight: 600; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">Type 1: Public Sheep Pen (Urban Setting)</h4>
                            <p>Multiple shepherds use one common pen with a gatekeeper. Each morning, shepherds come and call their sheep by name. The sheep recognize their shepherd's voice and follow him out.</p>

                                    "The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice."

                            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Application:</strong> How do you recognize God's voice? By hearing it often and frequently. This is why we must read the Bible regularly—to familiarize ourselves with His voice.</p>

                            <h4 style="font-weight: 600; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.75rem;">Type 2: Stone Sheep Pen (Rural Setting)</h4>
                            <p>In rural areas, a shepherd has his own stone pen with no gate and no gatekeeper. How does he protect the sheep from lions, bears, and wolves?</p>

                            "Many think this is the door of punishment. But it's actually the door of mercy. God prevented them from eating from the tree of life and living eternally in their sinful state, separated from Him forever."

                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Lesson:</strong> Sometimes God closes doors behind us not because He doesn't love us, but because He loves us too much. He redirects us to where He can reveal Himself.</p>
