                <p>We live in a world in which if you're not angry, you are not aware of what is going on. 🌍 From global upheaval to personal frustrations, anger surrounds us. Nepal didn't have a government all last week. 🇳🇵 The U.S. is experiencing assassinations and rage everywhere you look. 🇺🇸 You cannot protect yourself from outrage, from anger. ⚡</p>

                <p>Some of these reactions are very justified - you <em>should</em> feel angry about certain things. ✅ But on a more personal level, there are things that trigger you that maybe you shouldn't react to so strongly. 🎯 The question isn't whether you are angry, but how you deal with your anger, how you express your anger. 🤔 And many of us, I dare say, don't do it well. 😬</p>

                        <p><strong>If you come from a more westernized background,</strong> you may have been told that it is good to express your anger. Parenting books 20, 30 years ago would say things like, "Let the toddler kick the chair. He's expressing his anger." The problem is that toddler has now grown up and he's still kicking chairs. And sometimes kicking other things. Expressing it is not always good.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>If you come from a more eastern background,</strong> you may have been told or modeled: "Don't express your anger. Suppress it. Put it down. You shouldn't feel that way."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The Bible, in its beautiful wisdom, gives a better answer.</strong> It's not express it and it's not suppress it. It is to focus on the reality of what is going on within you, to analyze it and come up with a better and a third approach.</p>

Right up to that edge of sin, being angry puts you on this precipice of stepping over into sin. And yet you are called, demanded, expected even, to express some way anger that is still honoring of God."</p>

                        The essence of sin is disordered loves. You love things, but you love them too much. You have disorder among your affections, that you've made things that are good to love, you've made them ultimate things to love, that unless you have that then your life is destroyed.

                            <li><strong>The Real Problem:</strong> "I'm really mad at me because I've been irresponsible, because I left my wallet.

                            And in that moment, in relatively mild ways, I took my anger out on an unsuspecting, slightly sick bank teller. The poor bank lady did nothing wrong. In fact, she woke up and felt bad and put on a mask and went to work to do her job, to make some money, to care for her family, to keep our society going, and stupid little me with my issues, broiling weaves through the snake of a line and takes it out on her.

                <p>Pastor Brett reflects: "Isn't that good? 👍 My guess is most of us fall here. Not angry, but with cause. Like there's things you should be enraged about, things that you should care about, things that should really get under your skin that are holy things, righteous things, things that also bug God. 🙏 And yet you're like, 'nah,' 🤷‍♂️ but you're angry without cause, things that really don't matter, that for some reason trip you up." 🪤</p>

                    <div class="question-text">Of the four types of anger (explosive "shotgun," 🎆 silent but deadly, 🤐 slow burn, 🔥 sneaky 😏), which one do you feel most accurately describes your typical pattern? What might this reveal about your heart and your way of protecting yourself? 💖🛡️</div>

                    <div class="question-text">Do you feel you have a healthy amount of anger in your life? ⚖️ Are there injustices you should be more angry about (like Pastor Brett mentioned with child trafficking 👶⛓️ vs. MTR incidents 🚇)? Is there any unresolved anger that you need to process and bring to God? 🙏💬</div>

                    <div class="question-text">Think of a recent time you were angry (perhaps something as "minor" as Pastor Brett's bank experience 🏦😤). Apply the three-question framework: Were you hurt, 💔 frustrated, 😤 or afraid? 😨 What was God inviting you to learn about yourself in that moment? 📝✨</div>

                    <div class="question-text">Is there someone you need to extend grace to - perhaps someone who has hurt you? 🤗💔 How might God be calling you to "feed your enemy" 🍞 rather than seek revenge? ⚔️ What would "genuine care" for them look like practically? 💕👋</div>

                    <div class="question-text">Pastor Brett said, "At the core of most of our anger is us" 🪞 - our self-esteem, worth, schedule, money, relationships. 💰⏰💕 Where do you see yourself being "self-protective" 🛡️ rather than caring about things that grieve God's heart? 😢💖 How can you "get rid of that" and confess it? 🙏✨</div>

            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('proverbs1430-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Proverbs 14:30 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones."</strong></p>
            <p>This verse beautifully illustrates the physical impact of our emotional health. 💖🏥 When our hearts are at peace - not anxious, not angry, not envious - our bodies literally experience life and health. ✨ Conversely, negative emotions like envy and unresolved anger can cause physical decay and illness. 🦠😷</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett referenced medical research showing anger connected to over 51 different diseases, confirming this biblical truth about the mind-body connection. 📊🧠</em></p>

        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('exodus346-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Exodus 34:6 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, 'The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.'"</strong></p>
            <p>This is God's own self-description - His character revealed to Moses. 📜 Notice the order: compassionate, gracious, then slow to anger. 💕 God's anger is real, but it's surrounded by compassion and grace. His anger serves His love. ❤️</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett emphasized: "Notice that God isn't described as having no anger - He's described as being slow to anger. There's a rhythm here, a pacing." 🎵⏰</em></p>

        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('proverbs2429-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Proverbs 24:29 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"Do not say, 'I'll do to them as they have done to me; I'll pay them back for what they did.'"</strong></p>
            <p>The key phrase here is "do not say" - referring to the conversation we have with ourselves when we've been wronged. 🗨️💭 This internal dialogue of revenge and payback is where anger turns destructive. 💥</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett emphasized: "The point is, do not say that to yourself, but think about what is it that you are saying to yourself. When you're triggered, when you're enraged, what's going on?" 🤔💥</em></p>

    <div id="hebrews1215-modal" class="modal">

            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('hebrews1215-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Hebrews 12:15 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many."</strong></p>
            <p>Unresolved anger becomes like a bitter root that grows over time. 🌱⏰ Eventually, we can't even remember what originally made us angry, but the bitterness has become part of our character, affecting not just us but everyone around us. 😖👥</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett warned: "You will then be an angry old man. 👴😠 'Get off my lawn.' 🏠 You will be crotchety. And you will pass it down. ⬇️ And your children will describe you as angry or absent or bothered." 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦😢</em></p>

        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('peter223-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>1 Peter 2:23 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly."</strong></p>
            <p>This describes Jesus' response to injustice and cruelty. ⚖️😢 He didn't suppress His emotions or explode in anger. Instead, He actively chose to entrust Himself to God's perfect justice. 🙏✨</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett noted: "'Entrusted himself' is continuous action - He kept choosing this response moment by moment. 🔄⏰ This is our model for handling wrongdoing." 🎆</em></p>

    <div id="proverbs1632-modal" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('proverbs1632-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Proverbs 16:32 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city."</strong></p>
            <p>In ancient times, conquering a city required incredible military skill and strength. 🏛️⚔️ Yet God says that patience and self-control - especially in managing anger - represents even greater strength and accomplishment. 💪✨</p>
            <p><em>True strength isn't in expressing every emotion, but in governing our responses with wisdom - being "slow to anger" like God Himself. 🧠😌</em></p>
        </div>

    <div id="proverbs1429-modal" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('proverbs1429-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Proverbs 14:29 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"Whoever is patient has great understanding, but one who is quick-tempered displays folly."</strong></p>
            <p>Patience and understanding go together. 🤝 When we're quick-tempered, we make foolish decisions and say things we later regret. 😬😔 Patience gives us time to understand the situation and respond wisely. ⏰🧠</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett noted: "The 'morning after' perspective often shows us how foolish our quick-tempered responses were. 🌅😳 You've had this feeling where you've looked back on something that you did or you said and you're like, 'oh, it's kind of embarrassing.'" 🙈</em></p>

    <div id="proverbs1518-modal" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('proverbs1518-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Proverbs 15:18 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"A hot-tempered person stirs up conflict, but the one who is patient calms a quarrel."</strong></p>
            <p>Our response can either escalate or defuse a situation. ⬆️⬇️ Hot-tempered reactions create more conflict, while patient responses can actually calm existing quarrels. 🔥↔️😌</p>
            <p><em>We have the power to be peacemakers or conflict-stirrers with our emotional responses. 🕊️🔥 The choice is ours in each moment. ✅</em></p>

    <div id="proverbs1919-modal" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('proverbs1919-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Proverbs 19:19 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty. Rescue them, and you will have to do it again."</strong></p>
            <p>This verse highlights the cyclical nature of uncontrolled anger. 🔄 Unlike other emotions, anger can be addictive and self-perpetuating. 😵‍💫 You rescue an angry person from one consequence, but they'll create another situation requiring rescue. 🎭</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett explained: "Anger, unlike any other emotion, can be addictive. Can be cyclical. 🔄 You're mad. 😡 And somebody says, 'why are you so mad?' You say, 'I'm not mad.' And then you're mad that they're asking you why you're mad." 😤😵‍💫</em></p>

    <div id="jeremiah45-modal" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('jeremiah45-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Jeremiah 45:5 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"Should you then seek great things for yourself? Don't seek them."</strong></p>
            <p>This verse cuts to the heart of our self-centered anger. 🎯💖 When we're constantly seeking great things for ourselves - respect, comfort, convenience, vindication - we set ourselves up for constant anger when those things are threatened. 🛡️😡</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett's insight: "At the core of most of our anger is us. 🪞 Your self-esteem, your value, your worth, your respect... You're wrapped up in it. 🎁 And you love you so, so much that there are so many things that make you mad." 😡💥</em></p>

    <div id="proverbs2521-modal" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="closeModal('proverbs2521-modal')">&times;</button>
            <h3>Proverbs 25:21-22 (NIV)</h3>
            <p><strong>"If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat. If he's thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you."</strong></p>
            <p>This is not about passive-aggressive revenge through kindness. ❌😏 The "burning coals" metaphor refers to the ancient practice of carrying coals in a basket on one's head. 🧺🔥 Putting coals on someone's head meant contributing to their welfare - they would get home and wonder, "How did I get these extra coals?" 🏠🤔</p>
            <p><em>Pastor Brett emphasized: "It's not some passive aggressive, 'hey, you look great.' 😏 No. It's a genuine thing. 💖 Care for your enemy? Are you kidding me? 😱 I'm trying not to kill them. You want me to genuinely care for them." 🤯</em></p>
