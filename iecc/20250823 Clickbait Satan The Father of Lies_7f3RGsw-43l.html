The pattern, not just one thought, the pattern. Be aware of your behavior pattern. Not just one act, but your pattern. Be aware of what is going on in your heart, in your feeling, in your emotion. And also look for the pattern. That's why evening prayer is so good it's such a good practice if you don't have such a habit of evening prayer and reviewing your day i highly recommend you to do it takes about 10 maybe 15 minutes and you will be amazed how fruitful it can be you review it daily and that will give you clarity."</span>
