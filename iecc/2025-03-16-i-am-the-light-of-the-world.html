                Jesus says that He is the Light of the world. What does that mean? Why were the Israelites so offended by that statement? The first sermon in our "I AM" series exploring the significance of this statement and what it means for our lives.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #e0d6c0;">
                        The Festival of Tabernacles forms the backdrop for Jesus' bold declaration. During this festival, the Israelites erected massive columns in the temple court and lit enormous fires on top, creating a spectacular display of light visible throughout Jerusalem.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color: #e0d6c0;">
                        These fires commemorated the pillar of fire that guided their ancestors through the wilderness. On the final day of the festival, when these fires were extinguished, Jesus stood up and declared: "I am the light of the world."

                        Jesus claims to be the light that guides us, protects us, and dwells with us. This wasn't just a metaphor—it was a direct claim to divinity that paralleled God's presence in the Old Testament, which is why the religious leaders responded with such hostility.

                            Just as the pillar of fire guided the Israelites through the wilderness, Jesus guides us through life. But this isn't about divine illumination for every minor decision—it's about living according to the principles and teachings Jesus gave us.

                            When the Egyptian army pursued the Israelites to the Red Sea, the pillar of fire threw the army into confusion and protected God's people. Similarly, Jesus protects us from spiritual forces of evil.

                            There is a very real spiritual battle happening around us. Satan is described as "the prince of this world," free to run amok temporarily. But the light of Jesus protects us by freeing us from our enslavement to sin and evil.

                            For 40 years in the wilderness, God's glorious presence filled the tabernacle. Later, when Solomon built the temple, God's presence came and filled it. But when Israel fell into idolatry and disobedience, God's presence departed.

                                "Then the glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple... They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord's house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them."

                            By Jesus' time, the temple had been rebuilt, but God's presence was absent. For generations, the Jews prayed for God's presence to return. And then Jesus stood up and said, "I am the light. I've come back to dwell with you."

                    <ol style="line-height: 2;">
                        <li><strong>Judgment:</strong> "Your testimony is not valid" (John 8:13)</li>

                        <li><strong>Violence:</strong> They picked up stones to kill him (John 8:59)</li>

                        The very light they had been praying would return for centuries had to hide himself and slip away from the temple in darkness. How tragic. How ironic.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.125rem; color: #e0d6c0;">
                        Pastor Kevin shared a story from his recent vacation to New Zealand's Lake Pukaki, a certified dark sky reserve. When he tried to photograph the Milky Way with his iPhone, he got a disappointing dark image—but the professional photos showed stunning detail.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.125rem; color: #e0d6c0;">
                        The difference? <strong>Exposure time.</strong> The longer a camera lens is exposed to light, the more light it captures and the clearer the image becomes.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #e0d6c0;">Before we judge the Israelites too harshly, Pastor Kevin challenges us to consider: Are we really that different?</p>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">• Do we truly want his guidance? (Living by his principles is inconvenient and requires sacrifice)</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">• Do we truly want his protection? (We live in a post-truth world that rejects absolute truth)</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">• Do we truly want his presence? (His light exposes the ugly parts of ourselves we'd rather ignore)</li>

                                Pastor Kevin identified three characteristics of our current post-truth era:
                            </p>
                            <ol style="line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <li><strong>Erosion of trust</strong> in traditional sources of truth (news, government, science, Scripture)</li>
                                <li><strong>Prioritization of emotions</strong> over empirical evidence—if it doesn't feel right, we dismiss it</li>
                                <li><strong>Widespread false information</strong> that we believe if it resonates with our feelings</li>

                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                Result: We don't know right from wrong. We've abandoned Scripture as our source of truth and lean into our emotions, believing falsehoods that resonate with us.

                                John Mark Comer's book "Live No Lies" argues that Satan's main weapon is <strong>lies and deception</strong>. There is a sophisticated infrastructure—an intricate network of demons—working to compel us toward rebellion and unbelief.

                                Can you, by yourself, stand up against this coalition of evil and deception? Pastor Kevin urges us to reconsider.

                                All of us—Christian or not—have a desire for significance and purpose. Here's the beautiful message of the gospel:

                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                The Christian life after salvation and baptism is dedicated to becoming more and more like Jesus. The best—and necessary—way to do this is to be in his presence, allowing his light to expose the dirt and sin in your heart so you can deal with it and progress.

                                        "Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."

                                    Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. When you do this, you receive the light. That's the beautiful gospel message.

                            "Lord, we confess that there are many times and seasons where we have suppressed your light, walked away from your guidance, sought to defend ourselves without your protection, and tried to transform ourselves to be more like the world instead of more like Jesus."
