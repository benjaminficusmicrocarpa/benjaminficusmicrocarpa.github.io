            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8;">Like a pair of glasses, your <strong>worldview</strong> is the lens through which you view life. It forms your values, determines your decisions, and reveals your priorities. But so many don't even realize what their worldview is—they unconsciously adopt it from cultural or family expectations. As followers of Christ, we are called not to be conformed to the world's patterns, but to be <em>transformed</em>—rewired—by renewing our minds according to God's design.</p>

            <h2>📌 Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Everyone has a worldview</strong> — a lens or map that helps them navigate life, whether they realize it or not</li>
                <li><strong>Worldviews drive decisions</strong> — how you spend time, money, who you spend time with, your career choices</li>
                <li><strong>Christianity is not a Sunday hobby</strong> — it's an all-encompassing understanding of how life works</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional worldviews</strong> are grouped by belief in God: Theism, Polytheism, Pantheism, Atheism</li>
                <li><strong>Modern worldviews</strong> are grouped by view of reality: Naturalism, Transcendentalism, Theism, Postmodernism</li>
                <li><strong>Biblical worldview</strong> addresses five key questions: Origin, Meaning, Morality, The Fall, and Destiny</li>
                <li><strong>Rewiring is ongoing</strong> — we continuously adjust our thinking to align with God's design</li>
            </ul>

            <p>"A worldview is your underlying assumptions that help you discern your reality. So many times people just unconsciously create their own sense of meaning and value without having ever thought about it."</p>

                    <h3>What Is a Worldview?</h3>
                    <p>Pastor Brett opens by explaining that while most people don't consciously identify their worldview, everyone has one. It's the lens through which we see life, affecting every decision we make.</p>

                        <p><em>"A worldview is a comprehensive life system that answers all of humanity's age-old questions: Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? Does life have any meaning and purpose?"</em></p>

                    <p>The key insight: many people <strong>unconsciously</strong> adopt their worldview. They get tossed by waves of cultural or family expectations, jumping on trajectories of proving themselves and seeking importance—often leading to emptiness, resentment, and regrets.</p>

God, we thank you that life in all of its meaning means we are freed from the need to impress others, to manage our reputations. We are freed because of what you have said about us. You've made us in the imago Dei, the image of God. And so, God, we pray that we would reflect that image to those around us, to a world in need, to the 90%—would you use us to bring this good news to them? We thank you in Jesus' name. Amen."
