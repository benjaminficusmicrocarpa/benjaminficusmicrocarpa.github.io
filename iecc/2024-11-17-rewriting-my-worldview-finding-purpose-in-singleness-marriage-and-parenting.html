                        <p><strong>Thanksgiving:</strong> Thank God for the specific season of life He has you in right now, and for the unique opportunities it provides to serve Him.</p>
                        <p><strong>Confession:</strong> Ask forgiveness for areas where you've conformed to worldly expectations rather than biblical truth, or where you've been discontent with His timing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Supplication:</strong> Ask for wisdom to glorify God well in your relationships and daily choices. Pray for contentment and purpose in your current phase.</p>
                        <p><strong>Intercession:</strong> Pray for others in different life phases - singles longing for marriage, couples struggling in their relationship, parents feeling overwhelmed with training their children.</p>
                        <p><strong>Commitment:</strong> Ask God to help you love others well through intentional time investment, and to see every season as a gift for His glory.</p>
